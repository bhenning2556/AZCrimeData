### AZCrimeData
This project uses data about crime rates and a machine learning model to predict crime rates in the future. Data is collected manually from the [FBI crime database](https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/explorer/state/arizona/crime). All graphs and visualizations are created and outputted by script.py.

## Usage
Currently the project only facilitates the datasets that I downloaded, as the functions are written in a way that filters by custom filenames that I set for the data, but in the future this program could be modified to work for any dataset in the fbi dataset. Ideally, this program could be turned into a web app that can take in a few parameters and output a dynamic visualization of crime data and predictions. The code also needs some cleaning up, there is quite a bit of redundant code that I ignored orginally because I was more focused on putting together the presentation.
